# ♻️ Stage 11B — Reactivation Engine

← [Back to Master CJE Hub](https://www.notion.so/35be5082b9d481e38c42d3cadd012d94)

---

> **STAGE 11B OF 12 — Every cold lead and lost deal is a warm asset. They already know Nivy. Reactivating them costs 10x less than cold outreach and converts at 3x the rate.**
> 

---

## ♻️ Core Objective

> **Systematically re-engage cold leads, lost proposals, and churned clients through AI-personalized, multi-channel campaigns — converting dormant assets back into active pipeline.**
> 

This stage is engineered to:

- Never permanently discard any lead who engaged at any stage of the journey
- Segment dormant contacts by type and reason for going cold — and reactivate with the right message for each
- Use AI to generate hyper-personalized re-engagement that doesn't feel like a mass campaign
- Measure re-engagement signal quality and route re-warmed leads back into Stage 4 (management) or Stage 5 (nurture)
- Keep the pipeline full even during slow acquisition periods

**Inputs:** Cold leads (no activity >60 days) from Stage 4, failed nurtures (no conversion after 21-day Stage 5 sequence), lost proposals from Stage 6, churned clients from Stage 9, event no-shows from Stage 12

**Outputs:** Re-engaged leads re-entering Stage 4 (scored and re-routed), re-signed past clients re-entering Stage 7 (Onboarding), or permanently archived after 3 failed reactivation attempts

**Trigger to next stage:**

- Reactivated lead books call → Stage 6 (Conversion Engine)
- Reactivated lead engages but not ready → re-enter Stage 5 (Nurture, long track)
- Past client re-signs → Stage 7 (Onboarding Engine)
- No response after 3 reactivation cycles (90 days) → permanently archive in HubSpot

**Reactivation Segment Definitions:**

```jsx
SEGMENT 1 — Cold Leads (Stage 4/5 exits):
- Lead status: COLD in HubSpot
- Last activity: >60 days ago
- No booking, no reply in nurture
- Approach: New angle email → WhatsApp → community invite

SEGMENT 2 — Lost Proposals (Stage 6 exits):
- Deal stage: Closed Lost
- Reason: Budget / timing / went with competitor
- Last contact: >30 days ago
- Approach: "What changed?" email → follow-up call → new offer

SEGMENT 3 — Churned Clients (Stage 9 exits):
- Lifecycle: Ex-customer
- Contract ended, not renewed
- Last active: >60 days
- Approach: Personal AM call → results reminder → re-engagement offer

SEGMENT 4 — Event No-Shows (Stage 12):
- Registered for event/webinar but didn't attend
- No follow-up engaged
- Approach: Replay offer → new webinar invite → community invite

SEGMENT 5 — Email Unsubscribers:
- Unsubscribed from email list
- Still on WhatsApp or LinkedIn
- Approach: WhatsApp-only soft touch → community invite (no email)
```

## 📤 Outbound Systems

| System | Sequence | Tool | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reactivation email (Attempt 1) | Week 1: AI-personalized "checking in" | n8n + Gmail | 60 days since last activity |
| WhatsApp follow-up (Attempt 1) | Week 2: Personal check-in | n8n + WATI | 7 days after email, no reply |
| Reactivation email (Attempt 2) | Week 5: New angle / new offer / case study | n8n + Gmail | 30 days after Attempt 1 |
| LinkedIn DM (Attempt 2) | Week 6: Engage their content first, then DM | Manual / PhantomBuster | After Attempt 2 email |
| Final reactivation (Attempt 3) | Week 9: "Last message" — breakup email | n8n + Gmail | 30 days after Attempt 2 |
| Community invite (soft re-entry) | Any time after Attempt 1 fails | n8n + WATI | No reply after Attempt 1 |
| Archive notification | After 3 failed attempts | n8n + HubSpot | Automatic |

---

## 🔁 Community & Viral Loops

| Loop | Mechanism | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold lead → community member | Community invite as a "low pressure" re-entry point | Keep them in the ecosystem without needing a commitment |
| Community → warm lead | Cold leads who join community see active results → naturally re-warm | Passive reactivation through social proof |
| Past client → referral source | Even churned clients can refer if the relationship ends well | Recover value from non-renewing clients |
| Seasonal campaign reach | Holiday/quarter-end campaigns reach the entire cold list simultaneously | Mass reactivation with minimal effort |

---

## ⚙️ Automation Systems

| Automation | Tool | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**AI Prompt — Reactivation Email Generator:**

```jsx
You are writing a re-engagement email for Nivy Digital.

Lead/client details:
- Name: {{name}}
- Company: {{company}}
- Industry: {{industry}}
- Country: {{country}}
- Last interaction: {{last_interaction_description}}
- Days since last activity: {{days_cold}}
- Reason for going cold (if known): {{cold_reason}}
- Reactivation attempt number: {{attempt_number}} of 3

Instructions:
Attempt 1: Warm, human check-in. Don't mention they went quiet. Lead with a relevant insight or quick win for their industry. Soft CTA (reply if curious).
Attempt 2: New angle. Share a new case study or recent result from their industry. Make it feel fresh. CTA: book a 15-min call.
Attempt 3: "Breakup email" — honest, no pressure, creates FOMO. Something like: "I don't want to keep messaging if the timing isn't right — but I'd hate for you to miss X." CTA: one last link to book.

NEVER:
- Mention how long they've been quiet
- Sound like a generic marketing email
- Use "just checking in" or "I hope this finds you well"
- Write more than 120 words

Output: subject line + email body only. No extra text.
```

## 📋 SOP — Reactivation Execution Checklist

**Weekly (automated + manual):**

- [ ]  n8n runs Monday 9am: cold lead scan + AI reactivation emails sent (automated)
- [ ]  Review WATI for any WhatsApp reactivation replies → route to sales if positive
- [ ]  Check HubSpot "Reactivation Signals" view — any opens or clicks this week?
- [ ]  Any positive reply from reactivation email? → Move to Stage 4, assign to sales rep

**Monthly:**

- [ ]  Manually review top 10 lost proposals by deal value → personal AM outreach
- [ ]  AM contacts all churned clients from 60 days ago with personal "what changed?" email or call
- [ ]  Review reactivation campaign performance: open rate, reply rate, conversion
- [ ]  Identify best-performing reactivation angle this month → make it the default Attempt 1
- [ ]  Review archive list — any contacts wrongly archived? Restore if appropriate

**Seasonal Campaigns (quarterly):**

- [ ]  Build seasonal reactivation campaign for entire cold list (New Year, Diwali, financial year start)
- [ ]  Test a new subject line / angle on the seasonal batch
- [ ]  Measure seasonal campaign performance vs. standard reactivation sequence

## ⚠️ Risks & Bottlenecks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marked as spam | Medium | High | Personalize every email (AI), limit to 1 email/week per contact |
| Same message as last outreach | High | High | AI generates new angle each attempt — never repeat same approach |
| Emailing unsubscribers | Medium | High | Filter unsubscribers from email list before each batch |
| Over-contacting lost deals too soon | Medium | Medium | 30-day gap enforced between attempts via n8n |
| Archiving valuable contacts too early | Low | High | AM manual review of all archived contacts monthly |
| WhatsApp blocks from bulk messages | Medium | Medium | Space messages 5+ days, keep personal and non-promotional tone |

---

## 🔧 Optimization Systems

| System | Method | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reactivation email angle testing | Which approach (check-in / case study / breakup email) gets most replies? | Monthly |
| Segment performance comparison | Which segment reactivates best? Cold leads vs. lost proposals vs. churned? | Monthly |
| AI prompt refinement | Review email quality monthly → update prompt with what's working | Monthly |
| Seasonal campaign optimization | Which seasonal hook drives most engagement? | Per campaign |
| Archive quality audit | Review archived contacts — are they truly dead or misclassified? | Monthly |
| Re-engagement timing analysis | Is 60-day trigger right, or should it be 45 days or 90 days? | Quarterly |
