# 💌 Stage 5 — Nurturing Engine

← [Back to Master CJE Hub](https://www.notion.so/35be5082b9d481e38c42d3cadd012d94)

---

> **STAGE 5 OF 12 — Most leads don't buy on first contact. The Nurturing Engine keeps Nivy top-of-mind across every channel, automatically, until the prospect is ready to convert.**
> 

---

## 💌 Core Objective

> **Move WARM and COLD leads from curiosity to conviction — using automated, multi-channel, personalized sequences that build trust, demonstrate expertise, and create urgency over time.**
> 

This stage is engineered to:

- Prevent leads from going cold between capture and conversion
- Build a consistent relationship through email, WhatsApp, retargeting, and community
- Surface high-intent signals (re-opens, re-clicks, pricing page visits) in real time
- Auto-graduate WARM leads to HOT when their behavior signals readiness
- Deliver value at every touchpoint so Nivy feels like a trusted advisor, not a salesperson

**Inputs:** WARM leads (score 40–69) and COLD leads (score <40) from Stage 4 — segmented by industry, country, and service interest

**Outputs:** Score-upgraded leads ready for Stage 6 (Conversion), booked calls, audit requests, or re-engaged cold leads returning to pipeline

**Trigger to next stage:**

- Lead score crosses 70 → HOT → auto-exit nurture → Stage 6 (Conversion Engine)
- Lead books call directly from email/WhatsApp CTA → Stage 6
- Lead requests free audit → Stage 6
- No engagement after 21-day sequence → Stage 11B (Reactivation Engine)

**21-Day Nurture Sequence Blueprint:**

```jsx
Day 0  — Email: Welcome + lead magnet delivery
Day 1  — WhatsApp: "Did you get the resource?" check-in
Day 3  — Email: Case study (industry-matched) with real numbers
Day 5  — Email: "The #1 mistake [industry] businesses make with [service]"
Day 7  — WhatsApp: Personal check-in — any questions?
Day 10 — Email: ROI breakdown / free calculator
Day 12 — Email: Behind-the-scenes — how Nivy delivers results
Day 14 — Email: "Your free audit is still available" (soft CTA)
Day 16 — LinkedIn: Comment or engage with their post (manual touch)
Day 18 — WhatsApp: Direct invitation — "I'd love 20 mins with you"
Day 21 — Email: Final check-in — "Still thinking it over?"

If no engagement by Day 21 → move to Stage 11B Reactivation
If opens but no reply → extend to 30-day long track
If books call at any point → immediately exit to Stage 6

You are writing a nurture email for Nivy Digital.

Lead profile:

- Industry: {{industry}}
- Country: {{country}}
- Service interest: {{service_interest}}
- Pain point: {{pain_point}}

- Email theme: {{email_theme}}

Instructions:
- Open with a pattern-interrupt hook referencing their specific industry or problem
- Deliver genuine value (insight, example, or case study) in 120-150 words
- Soft CTA at end — no hard sell. Options: read article, download resource, reply with a question

- Never use generic phrases like "I hope this email finds you well"

Output: subject line + email body only. No extra text. No markdown formatting.
