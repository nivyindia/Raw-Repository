# 📊 Stage 8 — Delivery Engine

← [Back to Master CJE Hub](https://www.notion.so/35be5082b9d481e38c42d3cadd012d94)

---

> **STAGE 8 OF 12 — This is where Nivy's reputation is built or broken. World-class delivery creates trust, loyalty, referrals, and upsells. Average delivery creates churn.**
> 

---

## 📊 Core Objective

> **Deliver measurable transformation for every client — on time, with visible proof — so they feel the ROI, trust Nivy completely, and become long-term partners and advocates.**
> 

This stage is engineered to:

- Execute all service deliverables to agreed KPIs and timelines
- Maintain a real-time communication rhythm that keeps clients confident and informed
- Use AI to generate reports, detect performance issues, and recommend optimizations proactively
- Surface upsell opportunities naturally through delivery excellence
- Create the documented proof (results data) that feeds Stage 1 social proof and Stage 2 case studies
- Alert the team immediately when any client's metrics are underperforming

**Inputs:** Fully onboarded client from Stage 7 — questionnaire complete, access received, kickoff call done, project plan live in Notion

**Outputs:** Measurable client results against agreed KPIs, monthly AI-generated reports delivered, satisfied clients ready for Stage 9 (Retention), and flagged upsell opportunities routed to Stage 10

**Trigger to next stage:**

- Month 1 complete with results delivered → Stage 9 (Retention Engine) activated
- Client KPIs consistently exceeded for 2 months → Stage 10 (Expansion Engine) flagged
- Client KPIs underperforming for 2 weeks → immediate review + remediation protocol

## ⚠️ Risks & Bottlenecks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Late report delivery | Medium | High | n8n auto-generates — AM only needs to review, not write |
| Client KPIs underperforming silently | Medium | Critical | Automated KPI threshold alerts catch it in <48hrs |
| Client dissatisfaction building unnoticed | Medium | Critical | Monthly CSAT + weekly WhatsApp catches it early |
| AM capacity overload (>8 clients) | High | High | Hard cap at 8 clients per AM, trigger hire if exceeded |
| Campaign underperformance going unaddressed | Medium | High | Internal KPI review every week + team lead escalation |
| Quality inconsistency between deliverables | Medium | High | QC checklist mandatory before all client-facing work |
| Renewal missed / client lapses | Medium | High | 60-day renewal radar in HubSpot + AM proactive call |

---

## 🔧 Optimization Systems

| System | Method | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Report quality audit | AM reviews last 5 reports — are they improving client trust? | Monthly |
| KPI alert calibration | Review threshold sensitivity — too many or too few alerts? | Monthly |
| Client satisfaction driver analysis | CSAT + NPS data → what drives high/low scores? | Quarterly |
| Delivery process speed audit | Track time-to-complete per deliverable type → find slowdowns | Monthly |
| Case study harvest | Identify best-performing client results → build into Stage 1 content | Monthly |
| AM performance review | Close rate of upsells, CSAT per AM, renewal rate | Monthly |
