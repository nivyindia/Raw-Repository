# 🗂️ Stage 4 — Lead Management Engine

← [Back to Master CJE Hub](https://www.notion.so/35be5082b9d481e38c42d3cadd012d94)

---

> **STAGE 4 OF 12 — Captured leads mean nothing without a system to organize, score, and route them. This engine ensures every lead lands in the right place at the right time — nothing falls through the cracks.**
> 

---

## 🗂️ Core Objective

> **Organize, score, segment, and route every lead to the right salesperson or sequence at the right time — with zero manual guesswork.**
> 

This stage is engineered to:

- Create a single source of truth for every lead across all channels
- Assign AI-powered scores to every contact based on intent, ICP fit, and behavior
- Route HOT leads to sales within minutes, WARM to nurture, COLD to re-engagement
- Give the sales team a clean, prioritized pipeline — not a messy inbox
- Track every lead's journey so nothing gets lost, forgotten, or duplicated

**Inputs:** All captured leads from Stage 3 — form submissions, WhatsApp inbounds, cold email replies, comment captures, booking completions

**Outputs:** Scored, segmented, tagged contacts in HubSpot — enrolled in correct sequence, assigned to correct owner, with AI-generated priority tier

**Trigger to next stage:**

- HOT (score 70+) → Stage 6 (Conversion Engine) — sales contact within 2 hours
- WARM (score 40–69) → Stage 5 (Nurturing Engine) — auto-enrolled in sequence
- COLD (score <40) → Stage 5 long-track nurture → re-evaluate at 30 days
- VIP → Founder direct call, skip all sequences

  Timeline:         This month = 25pts | Next quarter = 15pts | Exploring = 5pts
  Company size:     >20 employees = 20pts | 5-20 = 12pts | Solo = 5pts
  Source quality:   Referral = 20pts | Inbound = 12pts | Cold outreach = 5pts
  Engagement:       Opened email = 5pts | Clicked = 10pts | Visited pricing = 20pts
  ICP match:        Perfect fit = 15pts | Partial = 8pts | Poor = 0pts

Score ≥ 70 → 🔥 HOT → Sales within 2 hours
